# what's going on here
This repository holds k8s configurations that I use in both dev and prod setups.

## What can I find here
- cilium installation
- gateway API crds installation
- a way to reset k3s cluster
- k3s kubeconfig copy function
- a way to create IP pool and annotate gateway service (so it has IP you pick for it)
